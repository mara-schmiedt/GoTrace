# GoTrace
**GoTrace is an open-source, privacy-first infrastructure toolset to equip pandemic response applications for global adoption.**

**The problem we are solving**

The rapid and unpredictable spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented challenge to our global health systems, economies and social fabric. Comprehensive testing, education and awareness of potential illness exposure are a cornerstone of effective and preventative pandemic responses.

Contact tracing is a data management and monitoring tool, which enables the identification of individuals that have been infected and/or those who have been exposed to individuals with the illness to take preventative measures and self-isolate.

Countries with strong democratic values require voluntary tracing schemes for socio-political acceptance, but risk to data privacy and civil rights present a hurdle to adoption. For contact tracing systems are to offer an effective pathway to prevention they must be widely adopted.

While 82% respondents of a 60-person survey we conducted during the hackathon agree that contract tracing apps could act as an effective lever of pandemic response, only 63% were likely to use them if available. When asked if they were likely to use a contact tracing applications that effectively safeguard data privacy and user anonymity, respondents were 20% more likely to use them.

Effective solutions will require solutions that enable unprecedented global self-reporting schemes, privacy and anonymity coordination. To close the close the 20% adoption gap privacy-first infrastructure tools are required.

The solution you bring to the table (including technical details, architecture, tools used)
GoTrace is an an open-source, privacy-first developer toolset to equip crisis applications for global adoption

Our solution allows developers to leverage open-source blockchain and decentralized storage components to extend their social tracing applications with enhanced privacy and security features.

The technology needed is immediately available but is new in this application context. We offer an solution architecture overview and a solution framework for developers. This enables secure data sharing, anonymous ID, in-app notifications, and incentive functionalities (ERC721/20 Ethereum Token Standards).

As this solution is open source, existing and new global contract tracing applications can implement this technology to help accelerate adoption and flatten the curve. Attached, you will find a picture of the high level architecture of the solution, followed by a more specific architecture to cater to the Coalition Network use case.

**The solutionâ€™s impact to the crisis**

Social contact tracing systems can only offer an effective pathway to prevention if they are widely adopted. According to a recent Oxford Study, it may require 56% participation of a population to allow for efficient pandemic response and spread mitigation. In terms of the EU population, this would require voluntary participation by 249.2 million individuals to achieve the Oxford Study benchmark.

Our user research indicates that developing an open-source, privacy-first developer tool can offer a pathway to close the 20% adoption gap. This would represent 89.2 million individuals whose adoption offers a pathway to more effective crisis response tools and saving lives, without sacrificing data-privacy and user anonymity. Moreover, improving contact tracing tools can accelerate and improve large-scale socio-economic mobility management.
